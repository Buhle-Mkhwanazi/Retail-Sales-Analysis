# Zenith Retail Sales Analysis

### Problem Statement
Zenith Retail, a mid-sized retail company specialising in diverse product categories, seeks to gain a deeper understanding of its sales performance, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns. The company's executive team has requested a comprehensive analysis of sales data to enhance business decision-making and optimise customer engagement strategies. The primary objective of this analysis is to clean and analyse transactional data, uncover key insights, and provide data-driven recommendations that will drive business growth and operational efficiency.

### Background and Overview
Zenith Retail operates across multiple product categories, catering to a diverse customer base. The company records transactional data in a database, capturing essential details such as transaction ID, customer ID, product category, quantity sold, cost of goods sold (COGS), total sale value, and customer demographics (age and gender). However, before conducting meaningful analysis, it is essential to ensure data quality by identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data points.

### To facilitate this analysis, I will:
- Assess the datasetâ€™s completeness by identifying missing or null values and removing incomplete records.
- Evaluate the number of total transactions and unique customers.
- Examine purchasing trends by identifying distinct product categories.
- Calculate key metrics, such as total sales per category, average age of customers purchasing beauty products, and high-value transactions exceeding a total sale of R1,000.
- Analyse customer behavior by determining the number of transactions made by each gender across different categories.
- Identify the top-performing customers based on total sales contributions.

### The key questions to be answered include:
- What is the total number of records and unique customers in the dataset?
- How many distinct product categories exist, and which categories generate the most sales?
- Are there missing values in the dataset, and how does data cleaning impact the integrity of the analysis?
- What are the customer demographics associated with each product category?
- Which transactions have the highest value, and which customers contribute the most revenue?
- How do purchasing behaviors vary across different genders and product categories?
